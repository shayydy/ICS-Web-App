This project is just designed to make a web application for a fake
ICS data company. It needs to have functions to register for an account, login, log out,
and is being created so that you can then run sast and dast against it to identify vulnerabilities, and fix them. 

Currently, it is not that useful since there are errors and it doesn't work, but at some point it'll be great
for learning how to make a web-app more secure, and understand more about how vulnerabilities get built in. 
Maybe great.  maybe not. 

Users can get started with this project if they figure out what's wrong with the code!

Users can help me with this project by helping me figure out what I did wrong, which is probably a lot if I'm being honest. 

Project created sort of by shayydy and maintained by whichever saints can help me fix it. 

File structure should look like:

Project 1
      .dotenv
      run.py
      Project(dir)
            base.py
            main.py
            __init__.py
            models.py
            auth.py
            venv(dir)
            __pycache__(dir)
